\title{Convert a character vector to a document term matrix of class Matrix.}
\usage{
Vec2Dtm(vec, min.n.gram = 1, max.n.gram = 2, remove.stopwords = TRUE,
  custom.stopwords = NULL, lower = TRUE, remove.punctuation = TRUE,
  remove.numbers = TRUE, stem.document = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec}{A character vector of documents. Punctuation etc. is allowed. names(vec) should be names of your documents.}

\item{min.n.gram}{The minimum size of n for creating n-grams. (Defaults to 1)}

\item{max.n.gram}{The maximum size of n for creating n-grams. (Defaults to 2. Numbers greater than 3 are discouraged due to risk of overfitting.)}

\item{remove.stopwords}{Do you want to remove standard stopwords from your documents? (Defaults to TRUE)}

\item{custom.stopwords}{If not NULL (the default) a character vector of additional stopwords to remove from your corpus. Note: it is generally faster to
remove additional stopwords by subsetting the columns of a DTM post-hoc. This is to be used when you want these words removed before creatign the DTM.}

\item{lower}{Do you want all words coerced to lower case? (Defaults to TRUE)}

\item{remove.punctuation}{Do you want to convert all punctuation to spaces? For example, "big-lipped fish" goes to "big lipped fish" (Defaults to TRUE)}

\item{remove.numbers}{Do you want to convert all numbers to spaces? For example, "3rd grade teachers" goes to " rd grade teachers" (Defaults to TRUE)}

\item{stem.document}{Do you want to stem the words in your document? (Defaults to FALSE)}
}
\description{
This is the main document term matrix creating function for IDA's text mining R package.
In most cases, all you need to do is import documents as a character vector in R and then run this function
to get a document term matrix that is compatible with the rest of IDA's R functionality.
