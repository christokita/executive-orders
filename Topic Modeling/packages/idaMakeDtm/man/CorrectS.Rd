\title{Function to remove some forms of pluralization.}
\usage{
CorrectS(term.vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{term.vec}{A character vector}
}
\description{
This function takes a character vector as input and removes some forms of pluralization
from the ends of the words.
}
\details{
The entries of the vector should be single words or short n-grams without punctuation as the
function only looks at the ends of strings. In other words, if entries are a paragraph of text. Only the
final words will get de-pluralized. (Even then, if the final character is a period, as would be the
case with paragraphs, it's likely that nothing will be de-pluralized.)
}
\note{
WARNING: This does make mistakes for irregular words. You should check its results manually. It tends to fail spectacularly for words ending in "es".
}
