Description: This package implements asymmetric latent Dirichlet allocation
    (LDA). Inference for all of these models is implemented via a fast
    collapsed Gibbs sampler written in C based on a modified version of John
    Chang's "lda" package. It also contains many IDA-developed functions for
    working with topic models.
