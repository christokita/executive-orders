To get non-connected nodes to outside:
1) Turn off "Stronger Gravity" and wait for all non-connected nodes to drift out
2) If you want to speed up the process turn up "Tolerance" to a value between 2 and 5
3) Turn on gravity, allowing the connected nodes to take the center. Turn "Tolerance" back to 0.1.
